    """
    Generates a Gaussian RF pulse.

    Args:
        duration (float): Pulse duration in seconds (defines the time window).
        bandwidth (float): Frequency bandwidth in Hz. This is often interpreted as FWHM.
                           The relationship between bandwidth and sigma depends on convention.
                           Here, we use sigma_factor to define sigma from duration.
                           Bandwidth parameter is not directly used in this sigma definition,
                           but is kept for signature consistency if interpretation changes.
        flip_angle_deg (float): Desired flip angle in degrees.
        sigma_factor (float, optional): Controls Gaussian width. sigma = duration / sigma_factor.
                                      A smaller sigma_factor gives a wider Gaussian relative to duration.
                                      A larger sigma_factor gives a narrower Gaussian (more truncated by duration).
                                      Defaults to 2.5, which truncates at +/- 2.5 sigma.
        gyromagnetic_ratio_hz_t (float, optional): Gyromagnetic ratio in Hz/T.
                                                   Defaults to GAMMA_HZ_PER_T_PROTON.
        dt (float, optional): Time step in seconds. Defaults to 1e-6 s (1 Âµs).

    Returns:
        tuple: (rf_pulse, time_vector)
            rf_pulse (np.ndarray): RF waveform in Tesla.
            time_vector (np.ndarray): Time points in seconds, centered around 0.
