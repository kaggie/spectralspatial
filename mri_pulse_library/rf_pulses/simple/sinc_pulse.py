                                 Total lobes = 2 * n_lobes. Defaults to 3.

        tuple: (rf_pulse, time_vector)

    # Sinc envelope: np.sinc(x) = sin(pi*x)/(pi*x)
    # The argument 'x' for np.sinc should represent time normalized by the lobe duration.
    # A common definition for a sinc pulse with 'n_lobes' (meaning n zero-crossings on each side of center):
    # The time for one lobe (distance between zero crossings) is t_lobe = duration / (2 * n_lobes) if duration is full extent.
    # Or, if bandwidth is FWZM, and it corresponds to n_lobes, then sinc argument is time * (n_lobes / duration_main_lobe)
    # The prompt uses `sinc_arg = (bandwidth / n_lobes) * time`. This seems to imply that `bandwidth / n_lobes` is a frequency.
    # Let's use a common definition: time-bandwidth product (TBW) = duration * bandwidth.
    # For a sinc pulse, TBW often refers to the number of lobes * 2, or related to it.
    # If bandwidth is FWZM of main lobe, and pulse has N zero crossings (N/2 lobes on each side):
    # sinc(t * N / duration) or sinc(t * bandwidth_nominal).
    # Let's assume `n_lobes` refers to the number of zero crossings from center to edge of pulse.
    # So, argument for np.sinc should be `time * n_lobes / (duration / 2)`.
    # This makes `np.sinc(n_lobes)` at `t = duration/2`.
    # Or, if bandwidth is defined as `k * n_lobes / duration`, then `sinc(time * bandwidth / k_factor)`.
    # The prompt's `sinc_arg = (bandwidth / n_lobes) * time` suggests `bandwidth/n_lobes` is the effective frequency for normalization.
    # If `n_lobes` is the number of side lobes (e.g., 3 means 3 on each side of main), then total zero crossings might be related.
    # A typical sinc pulse is sinc(t/T) where T is related to lobe width.
    # If `n_lobes` means the argument to sinc goes from -n_lobes to +n_lobes over the duration:
    # x = n_lobes * (2 * time / duration)
    # sinc_env = np.sinc(x)

    # The interpretation of 'bandwidth' and 'n_lobes' for sinc is crucial.
    # Standard sinc for slice selection: B(t) = sinc(2*pi*W*t) where W is related to bandwidth.
    # np.sinc(x) means sin(pi*x)/(pi*x). So x = 2*W*t.
    # If 'bandwidth' is full width of main lobe (between first zero crossings), then BW = 2/T, where T is pulse duration for main lobe.
    # If duration is the full pulse length, and it contains `effective_n_lobes` on each side of center:
    # sinc_arg = time * (effective_n_lobes * 2 / duration) # makes argument go up to effective_n_lobes at t=duration/2
    # This is equivalent to `time / (duration / (2 * effective_n_lobes))`.
    # Let's use: `sinc_arg = time * effective_n_lobes * 2 / duration`
    # This way, `effective_n_lobes` directly controls the number of zero crossings in `[-duration/2, duration/2]`.
