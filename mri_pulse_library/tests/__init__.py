# mri_pulse_library/tests/__init__.py
# This file makes the 'tests' directory a Python package.
# It's useful for test discovery tools like pytest.

# You can define package-level fixtures or helper functions here if needed,
# though often test utilities are kept in separate files like 'conftest.py'
# or 'test_utils.py'.
