# mri_pulse_library/examples/__init__.py
# This __init__.py makes 'examples' a regular package,
# which can be useful if examples import from each other or use common utilities.
# However, for simple script-like examples, it might not be strictly necessary
# if they are run directly and reference the main library via PYTHONPATH.

# Example:
# from . import example_utils # If you have common utilities for examples
