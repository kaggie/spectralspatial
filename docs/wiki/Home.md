# MRI Pulse Library Wiki

Welcome to the documentation for the MRI Pulse Library! This library provides tools for designing and simulating various types of RF pulses used in Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

## Available Pulse Design & Simulation Modules

Below are links to pages detailing specific pulse types, design algorithms, and simulators available in this library:

*   [Universal pTx Pulses](./UniversalPTxPulses.md) - Designing pTx RF pulses robust to inter-subject B1/B0 variations.
*   [Adiabatic Pulses & CEST](./AdiabaticCESTPulses.md) - Generating adiabatic pulse waveforms (HS, BIR-4, WURST) and simulating multi-pool systems for CEST/T1rho.
*   [pTx Spokes Pulses](./PTxSpokesPulses.md) - Designing jointly optimized RF and gradient waveforms for tailored 3D excitation.
*   [SLR Pulses](./SLRPulses.md) - Designing selective RF pulses using the Shinnar-LeRoux algorithm.

More content will be added as the library evolves.
